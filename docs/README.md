## Features 

### Storage of task-list on hard-disk
Duke will automatically load previously added tasks from the hard-disk
and also save all added tasks to the hard-disk when Duke is closed.

### Datetime format understood by Duke
Currently, Duke only understands date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and time in the 24-hour format `HHMM`.
Whenever date and time needs to be supplied by the user, the format should be `YYYY-MM-DD HHMM`.
(`Y` stands for year, `M` stands for month, `D` stands for date, `H` stands for hour and `M` stands for minutes)

If the date and time information provided cannot be understood by duke or no date or time or 
both is not provided, the date and time will be automatically set to one week from current date. 
Additionally, there will be another line output:
```
Sorry. Date and Time cannot be parsed
```
