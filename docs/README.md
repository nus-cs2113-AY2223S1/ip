  [D][X] buy book (by: Aug 12 2022, 6.05pm)
```

For Empty List, the program simply prints the following message:

<br/>

### <span style = "background-color: #E9ECAB">unmark</span> - Unmark a Task (Non-Empty List)
Format:`unmark Task_Index`

  [D][ ] buy book (by: Aug 12 2022, 6.05pm)
```

For Empty List, the program simply prints the following message:
```

<br/>

### <span style = "background-color: #E9ECAB">delete</span> - Deletes a Task (Non-Empty List)

## Active Task Save
There exist a storage that automatically updates its internal list at the instance when a task is added, marked, unmarked or deleted within the record list. The list stored in the storage will be retained even after the program closes and will automatically be loaded back into the program when it is relaunched.

Note: Storage refers to data text file
