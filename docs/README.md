## FAQ
Q: Are the commands case-sensitive?

A: No, you can have any mix of lower and upper lettercase as long as the command is spelled correctly. 
e.g. "deadline" and "DeadLiNE" both works

Q: How do I transfer my list of tasks and all associated data to another computer?

A: Transfer the text file named "Tasks.txt", located in the same directory as your CS2113_IP.jar file, over to your other computer. Place it in the same directory as the CS2113T_IP.jar file on your other computer. Your tasks will then be loaded from this text file when you run CS2113T_IP.jar on your new computer.
