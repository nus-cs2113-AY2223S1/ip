Please enter your taskList command: (send 'bye' to exit)
```
1. Type a command and press Enter to execute it.
2. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

## Features

> Notes about the command format:
> - Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    e.g. in `event NAME /at TIME`, `NAME` and `TIME` are parameters which can be used as `event basketball /at noon`.
> - `TIME` will be stored as plain string. The onus is up to the user to save `TIME` data in a format that is meaningful to them.
### Listing all tasks: `list`

Tasks types are displayed within the first square bracket, where the letter inside

- D for a deadline task 
- E for an event task

The letter X in the second square bracket represents tasks that are marked as done
and no letter indicates that the task is yet to be done.
