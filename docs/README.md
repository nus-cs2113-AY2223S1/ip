# User Guide

Duke is a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) based desktop application which 
will help the user plan their tasks. It allows users to add or delete three categories of tasks: todos, deadlines,
and events. They can mark these as done or not done and can also see a list of their tasks at
any particular point in time. Additionally, they can search for all tasks containing a particular keyword. 
The application will save the tasks and reload them every time the user restarts the application so it can store the list as a memory.
