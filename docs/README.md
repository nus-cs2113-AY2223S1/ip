**Duke is a task manager application run on the command line interface  
Duke is powered by Slave Kai, Zhou Zhou's 256 IQ bot

## Features

**Duke recognises 3 types of tasks: ToDos, Deadlines and Events**

> ### Add tasks
>Add a new task to track  
> Each task has a completion status and task description  
> Each deadline & event has a date and optional time

> ### Modify tasks
>Make changes to existing tasks:
>- Mark a task as done or not done (tasks done are marked with 'X')
>- Delete a task *(this action is irreversible!)*

> ### View tasks
>List all tasks, or filter tasks by:
>- keyword - tasks containing the keyword in their description
>- date - tasks (of types deadline and event) before, on, or after a particular date
>- completion status - tasks that are done or not done
>
>> **Tasks are displayed in the format:**
>>```
>>{number}.[{type}][{done status}] {description} ({date} {time} (if applicable))  
>>```
>>**Example:**
>>```
>>3.[D][X] make a new friend (31 Dec 2021 23:59)
>>```
>>Tasks are displayed in the order by which they were added

> ### Save and load tasks
>Slave Kai will save your tasks and reload them the next time you run Duke  
> The saved tasks are stored in src/main/java/duke/data/data.txt  
> Slave Kai will automatically create a new save file if one does not exist
